# random-user-and-password

A few things i would like to improve on in writing the code if anyone could help. All I wanted to do was to create a random password without using multiple "pw[rand() %..." for each line. However,it only printed out one line of a password, so i stuck with this annoying method. Second, I wanted to convert the first character from the list of names from the file to lower case. I tried, but that didn't work either. I may have had to add sum additional functions in doing so, but I tried writing this quickly.
